Styling
The app uses Tailwind CSS with a custom color scheme defined in src/styles/globals.css. Modify the CSS variables to change the appearance:

:root {
  --primary-500: #your-primary-color;
  --accent-500: #your-accent-color;
  /* ... other color variables */
}

Data Storage
All user data is stored in localStorage. To clear data:
localStorage.clear();

🔧 Configuration

The app no longer includes payment or support features, so no additional configuration is required for payments.
